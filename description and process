Designed and optimized SQL queries for efficient data extraction and aggregation.
Sales and Revenue Insights:

Calculated monthly revenue trends, cumulative sales, and average product sales using advanced SQL window functions.
Implemented Python visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for time-series trends, product category sales, and geographical insights.
Customer Behavior Analysis:

Identified high-value customer segments and top-performing cities by grouping and filtering data.
Calculated the average number of products per order per city using SQL subqueries and joins.
